📊 Student Performance Data Exploration

Project: Impact of Family Support on Final Grades (G3)

This project is a simple, foundational exploration of real-world data, created to develop basic competency in data manipulation and visualization using Python's core libraries. It aligns with my goal of preparing for a Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence degree by establishing a strong programming base.

🎯 Goal of the Analysis

To investigate a single, clear question within the dataset: Does having family educational support ('famsup') correlate with a higher average final math grade (G3)?

The analysis uses basic descriptive statistics (calculating the mean) and clear visualization to present a verifiable finding.

🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used

Python: The core language for scripting and analysis.

Pandas: Used for efficient data loading, cleaning, selecting specific columns, and grouping data for analysis.

Matplotlib / Seaborn: Used to create the final bar chart visualization, allowing for clear presentation of results.

📝 Key Steps and Learning Points

This project was intentionally kept simple to demonstrate mastery of the foundational steps of any data science workflow:

Data Loading: Successfully reading a CSV file from a remote URL into a Pandas DataFrame.

Data Cleaning: Selecting only the required features (famsup and G3) and mapping the categorical data (converting 'yes'/'no' text into clear, consistent labels for the chart).

Basic Analysis: Using the .groupby().mean() function to calculate the average grade for two distinct groups of students.

Visualization: Presenting the findings in an easily understandable Bar Chart, proving the ability to communicate data insights effectively.

📈 Conclusion

The analysis showed that students who reported having family educational support achieved a slightly higher average final math grade (G3) compared to those without.

This project confirms my technical motivation and my ability to write structured Python code to solve a data-driven problem. It has also highlighted the need for the rigorous algorithmic and statistical foundation offered by the Foundation Year to move beyond simple exploration and into complex predictive modeling.
